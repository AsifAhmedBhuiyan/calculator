## Welcome

Hello, world. I am Asif, Software developer. 

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations and allows users to enter floating-point numbers. The calculator will have a clear button, and the result will be displayed as soon as the user presses the ' = ' button. The display will show both numbers and operators.

## Requirements

- Design a basic and recognizable calculator using HTML and CSS.
- Implement the following features:
  - Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
  - Ability to enter floating-point numbers.
  - Display the result immediately after pressing the ' = ' button.
  - Clear button to reset the calculator.
  - Display section to show numbers and operators.
  
## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

- **HTML**: The structure of the calculator interface.
- **CSS**: Styling for the calculator interface.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for performing arithmetic operations and updating the display.
